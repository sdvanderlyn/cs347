   <p>Hello and welcome to the first installment of my new blog as I explore differrent aspects and topics related to Web developement,<br>
      HTML, Javascript, and CSS! Coming into this class I didnt have much experience with any of those, so buckle up for a wild ride. :) <br></p>

    <p> Hacking! Coming into this class I didn't think that a thing like HTML or Javascript could be for hacking in ethical or unethical ways. <br>
        I found it rather interesting how using HTML you could inspect a web pages elements through the browser and alter the code during a <br>
        purposeful failed login to crack a low level secured website. This is possible by removing the failed login Javascript code and replacing it with a valid <br>
        line instead. This method is again only for simple protected websites, however there is a great need for precise detail to ensure that the <br>
        process is done right.
        <br>

        Another type of hacking I learned of is called "ethical hacking". This is where people try to find flaws and gaps that can be fixed before someone <br>
        with bad intentions try to gain access inside the network. Javascript is used inside of html to try to find ways into servers because this can escalate <br>
        into gaining access to networks and endless possibilities for the hacker to exploit. Another form of hacking is for personal use, here the goal is just <br>
        to achieve a more effecient browser and a better experience on the web. One can create add-ons with javascript or insert simple lines of code to learn about <br>
        the document's details, removing ads and pictures, and other things to better personl use of the web.
