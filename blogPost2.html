        In today's blog I looked into the various types of animations you can create using CSS, <br>
        what you can create animations for, and what you can do with animations. The main properties of <br>
        animations include: transformations, transitions, and keyframes. Transformations relate to the movement, <br>
        the size, location, and other things which dont change but alter the objects appearance. Transitions are <br>
        all about how well you can perform the transition smoothly. Keyframes are the exact timing you want to change an <br>
        animation at a given time or state. <br>

        The code sample above is to show the CSS for making an object increase in its scale. Animations can be used on <br>
        backgrounds, objects, photos, buttons, and symbols to say the least. CSS really provides a nice library of tools <br>
        for individuals to have tons of options to create a nice GUI and enhance user experience. Making 3D effects and <br>
        interactive details part of your web design strategy can differentiate your site from competitors.
