        In today's blog I looked into the various types of animations you can create using CSS, <wbr>
        what you can create animations for, and what you can do with animations. The main properties of <wbr>
        animations include: transformations, transitions, and keyframes. Transformations relate to the movement, <wbr>
        the size, location, and other things which dont change but alter the objects appearance. Transitions are <wbr>
        all about how well you can perform the transition smoothly. Keyframes are the exct timing you want to change an <wbr>
        animation at a given time or state. <wbr>
