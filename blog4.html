    Interaction design (ID) is a form of Human : Computer interaction and is defined as the structure and behavior of interactive systems <br>
    to create a better user experience. Some priciples of interaction design are discoverability, signifiers, and feedback. Discoverability <br>
    is important to ID as users wont want to waste time looking around icons they actually need, so to prevent this all icons should be labeled or <br>
    given a name. Signifiers are important becuase they must be present when an object has optional uses to confirm the action desired is what <br>
    is being done. Feedback is important to notify users that the desired or undesired action took place, in order to provide continous information <br>
    on their actions. Lastly, great interaction design restricts the user of every action possible, but instead shows whats important to the user at <br>
    any given time. <br> 
    <br>
    Page layouts, formating, and other changeable aspects of a web page should be crafted towards the expecected users and viewers of the page. Conventional <br>
    page layouts are left sided leaning in which most content and text will be on that side of the screen. While this is standard, interfaces need to be clean, <br>
    aesthetically pleasing, and clear on the point of the pages intentional uses. Great websites are able to build around the standards in the community and add <br>
    own flair needed to standout, however revolutionary one's can take on more creativity adding animations, bold color options, unique layouts, and newly created <br>
    interactions that are used by everyone else.
