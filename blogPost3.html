        Chatbots are a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, and todays blog focused on over the internet. <br>
        Early chatbots started out with lists of different expected inputs from users and pre-selected answers to be outputted. Chatbots were <br>
        created to take human interactation out of repetitively asked questions and actions done in fields like customer service and tasks to prevent <br>
        queues forming on hot lines and chat support. With more advances, chatbots are able to access systems and databases to provide even further <br>
        assistance to companies and organizations to reach clients needs at a faster rate. <br>
        <br>
        Today, chatbots are being equipped with artificial inteligence to make more realistic forms of life. The is done by a predictive model software <br> 
        where the inputed text, voices, and writings are transformed into the most relevant and applicable continuation there is to produce an output that <br>
        is close to human interaction. On the business side of things, this ability to quickly take in writing and other inputs will pave the way for faster <br> 
        contractual paperwork and documentation in multi-langual environments. <br>
