<h1><font size="+8"> <u> What helped?</u> </font></h1>
<p> 
    The textbook that Dr.Johnson is writing has been really helpfull along the way to learning things <br>
    so far in CS347. The labs when not too complicated really helped me with learning new things in the <br>
    class. Considering I had no experience in web developement, those two things helped make the class less <br>
    confusing for me at the begining of the semester and towards the projects we came across. 
</p>

<h1><font size="+8"> <u> What would help?</u> </font></h1>
<p>
    The blogs for me personally were a bit of a pro and a con, as I didn't know much about the topic and felt <br>
    rather uncertain if I was looking into helpfull topics or just random areas that wernt benificial to a newbie.<br>
    The pro of the blog is that they helped me mess around in css and figure out different techniques and uses of it. <br>
    Another thing I would add to more guided blogs is adding a bit more attention or detail to jss, js, and css. I felt <br>
    like once we hit js the level of understanding dropped from high to low as learning it felt like I had to figure out <br>
    what you were doing on the board and where to start, instead of having a good footing.
</p>

<h1><font size="+8"> <u> What would I plan?</u> </font></h1>
<p>
    I would plan a similiar expericence to the class that I recevied this fall if I were to teach it in the spring. The only thing I'd <br>
    change was how long we spent on topics for projects 2 and 3, and take away how much we spent on HTML 1 as I learned a lot for project 1<br>
    from things I learned outside of class time. So that would have been a better expericence as we wrapped up the semester instead of feeling <br>
    rather rushed at the end.
</p>

<h1><font size="+8"> <u> How would I design the course?</u> </font></h1>
<p>
    I actually really liked the design of the course with the daily labs, occassional blogs, and projects that we've had throughtout the course.<br>
    Sometimes however some labs felt like they were more lecture like to start the class when you'd show the class where to start and then I'd be lost <br>
    again. So I think I woudld've preferred the classes around the more challenging parts of the schedule would be more like a lecture day where you not <br>
    only kind of repeat whats in Dr.Johnson's book, but also where we can have a discussion. I know it seems counter productive, but I'd propose a pogil / on <br>
    paper type of assignments where I know as a group there'd be clarification and discussion, like a code review type of whats happening, or for crud a fill in <br>
    the blank like activity to make sure understanding was happening.
